# Hotel Booking Cancelling's Analysis and Visualization
# Overview
Online travel booking companies may experience a drop in revenue due to customer uncertainty in booking or cancelling. As a result, companies want to know what factors influence a customer's decision to cancel a reservation. Thanks to data science, we have a tool to help the company predict whether or not a customer will cancel a reservation based on the historical data provided. We will focus on EDA so that we can provide a analytical method that can predict whether or not a customer will cancel a reservation.

# Data
The data used is the processed result from the original data downloaded from Kaggle ([Hotel Revenue](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/govindkrishnadas/hotel-revenue)). In this assignment, I only focus on analyzing the factors that affect or are related to booking cancellations. The fields used are hotel, is_canceled,market_segment,  stays_in_week_nights, stays_in_weekend_nights, total_of_special_requests, and adr.
